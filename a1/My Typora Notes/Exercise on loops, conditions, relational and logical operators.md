## Exercise on loops, conditions, relational and logical operators

### Printing patterns:

Consider * as our patter and try to solve basic to complex patterns by the easiest way of understanding.

##### Problem 1:	Print a vertical line having a range of 7.....

###### Solution:

- Always think about considerations like which way I need to solve this problem in a simplest way.
- Here '*' need to be print 7 times in a vertical line, so the patter has to print repeatedly for 7 times. In such case we always prefer the inbuilt function loops.
- Since the condition is defined, for loop is preferred here as we don't need to initialise and increment.
